You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatRnD is a research team powered by multiple intelligent agents, with roles such as principal investigator, phd student, postdoc researcher, lab manager, research intern and more. The goal is to produce scientific report and modules that can be tested via code deployments.'
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatRnD. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: multi trajectories monte carlo random walk, make sure user can re-run experiment, each experiment should generate .csv output of trajectories and result be plotted and saved to image_datetime.png. Include a detailed .md file for the theory review including derivation when possible .
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To complete the task, we will create the following files:

1. `main.py`: This file will serve as the entry point for the software and will contain the GUI implementation.

2. `random_walk.py`: This file will contain the implementation of the multi-trajectories Monte Carlo random walk.

3. `csv_writer.py`: This file will handle the generation of the CSV output file.

4. `plotter.py`: This file will handle the plotting and saving of the result as an image.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:

```python

Next, let's move on to the `random_walk.py` file:

```python

Moving on to the `csv_writer.py` file:

Finally, let's create the `plotter.py` file:

```python

With these files, we have implemented the multi-trajectories Monte Carlo random walk software with a GUI. The user can enter the number of trajectories, run the experiment, and the software will generate a CSV output file with the trajectories and save a plot of the result as an image.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatRnD have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

Priority Comment: The `filedialog` module is not imported in the `csv_writer.py` file.

To fix this issue, you need to import the `filedialog` module in the `csv_writer.py` file. Add the following line at the top of the file:

```python
from tkinter import filedialog
```

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

Priority Comment: The `filedialog` module is not imported in the `csv_writer.py` file.

To fix this issue, you need to import the `filedialog` module in the `csv_writer.py` file. Add the following line at the top of the file:

```python
from tkinter import filedialog
```

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatRnD have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatRnD is a research team powered by multiple intelligent agents, with roles such as principal investigator, phd student, postdoc researcher, lab manager, research intern and more. The goal is to produce scientific report and modules that can be tested via code deployments.'
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatRnD. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: multi trajectories monte carlo random walk, make sure user can re-run experiment, each experiment should generate .csv output of trajectories and result be plotted and saved to image_datetime.png. Include a detailed .md file for the theory review including derivation when possible .
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code seems to be missing the import statements for the required modules. Specifically, the following imports are missing:

- In `main.py`, the import statement for `MultiTrajectoriesRandomWalk` from `random_walk.py` is missing.
- In `csv_writer.py`, the import statement for `filedialog` from `tkinter` is missing.
- In `plotter.py`, the import statement for `datetime` from `datetime` is missing.

To fix this, you can add the missing import statements at the top of each respective file. Here are the suggested import statements:

In `main.py`:
```python
from random_walk import MultiTrajectoriesRandomWalk
```

In `csv_writer.py`:
```python
from tkinter import filedialog
```

In `plotter.py`:
```python
from datetime import datetime
```

Once you add these import statements, the code should be able to run without any import errors.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code seems to be missing the import statements for the required modules. Specifically, the following imports are missing:

- In `main.py`, the import statement for `MultiTrajectoriesRandomWalk` from `random_walk.py` is missing.
- In `csv_writer.py`, the import statement for `filedialog` from `tkinter` is missing.
- In `plotter.py`, the import statement for `datetime` from `datetime` is missing.

To fix this, you can add the missing import statements at the top of each respective file. Here are the suggested import statements:

In `main.py`:
```python
from random_walk import MultiTrajectoriesRandomWalk
```

In `csv_writer.py`:
```python
from tkinter import filedialog
```

In `plotter.py`:
```python
from datetime import datetime
```

Once you add these import statements, the code should be able to run without any import errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatRnD is a research team powered by multiple intelligent agents, with roles such as principal investigator, phd student, postdoc researcher, lab manager, research intern and more. The goal is to produce scientific report and modules that can be tested via code deployments.'
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatRnD. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: multi trajectories monte carlo random walk, make sure user can re-run experiment, each experiment should generate .csv output of trajectories and result be plotted and saved to image_datetime.png. Include a detailed .md file for the theory review including derivation when possible .
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatRnD have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatRnD. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: multi trajectories monte carlo random walk, make sure user can re-run experiment, each experiment should generate .csv output of trajectories and result be plotted and saved to image_datetime.png. Include a detailed .md file for the theory review including derivation when possible .
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

1) In the `csv_writer.py` file, the `filedialog` module is imported but not used. You can remove the import statement to avoid confusion.

2) In the `csv_writer.py` file, the `asksaveasfilename` function from the `filedialog` module is used to prompt the user for a filename. However, the code does not handle the case when the user cancels the file dialog. You can add a check to handle this case and gracefully exit the function.

Here's the revised code for `csv_writer.py`:

```python
import csv
from tkinter import filedialog

class CSVWriter:
    def write(self, trajectories):
        filename = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".csv")
        if not filename:  # Check if the user cancels the file dialog
            return
        with open(filename, "w", newline="") as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow(["x", "y"])
            for trajectory in trajectories:
                for x, y in trajectory:
                    writer.writerow([x, y])
```

Other than these minor improvements, the code looks good and meets the requirements specified by the user. You can proceed with testing and further development.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided seems to be well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

1) In the `csv_writer.py` file, the `filedialog` module is imported but not used. You can remove the import statement to avoid confusion.

2) In the `csv_writer.py` file, the `asksaveasfilename` function from the `filedialog` module is used to prompt the user for a filename. However, the code does not handle the case when the user cancels the file dialog. You can add a check to handle this case and gracefully exit the function.

Here's the revised code for `csv_writer.py`:

```python
import csv
from tkinter import filedialog

class CSVWriter:
    def write(self, trajectories):
        filename = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".csv")
        if not filename:  # Check if the user cancels the file dialog
            return
        with open(filename, "w", newline="") as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow(["x", "y"])
            for trajectory in trajectories:
                for x, y in trajectory:
                    writer.writerow([x, y])
```

Other than these minor improvements, the code looks good and meets the requirements specified by the user. You can proceed with testing and further development."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

# Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk User Manual

## Introduction

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software is designed to simulate and visualize random walks in a 2D space. It uses the Monte Carlo method to generate multiple random trajectories and provides the ability to re-run the experiment. The software generates a CSV output file containing the trajectories and saves the resulting plot as an image file.

## Installation

To use the Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

2. Run the following command to start the software:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The software GUI will open, displaying a text field to enter the number of trajectories and a "Run Experiment" button.

4. Enter the desired number of trajectories in the text field and click the "Run Experiment" button.

5. The software will generate the random trajectories, save them as a CSV file, plot the trajectories, and save the plot as an image file (image_datetime.png).

6. A success message will be displayed in the GUI indicating that the experiment has been completed successfully.

7. The CSV file containing the trajectories will be saved in the directory where the software is located.

8. The plot image file (image_datetime.png) will also be saved in the same directory.

## Theory Review

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate random walks in a 2D space. The random walk is generated by starting at the origin (0, 0) and randomly moving in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The walk continues until the walker reaches a boundary defined by a maximum absolute value of 10 for both x and y coordinates.

The software allows the user to specify the number of trajectories to generate. Each trajectory is represented as a list of (x, y) coordinates, starting from the origin and ending at the boundary. The trajectories are stored in a CSV file, with each row representing a single (x, y) coordinate.

The software also provides a visualization of the trajectories by plotting them on a 2D graph. The x and y coordinates of each trajectory are plotted as a line, resulting in a visual representation of the random walk. The plot is saved as an image file for further analysis or presentation.

For a detailed derivation and explanation of the Monte Carlo method and random walks, please refer to the accompanying .md file.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software provides a user-friendly interface to simulate and visualize random walks in a 2D space. It allows the user to easily generate multiple trajectories, save them as a CSV file, and visualize the results. The software is designed to be easily re-runnable, allowing for further experimentation and analysis.

The software generates a CSV output file containing the trajectories and saves the resulting plot as an image file.

## Installation

To use the Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

2. Run the following command to start the software:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The software GUI will open, displaying a text field to enter the number of trajectories and a "Run Experiment" button.

4. Enter the desired number of trajectories in the text field and click the "Run Experiment" button.

5. The software will generate the random trajectories, save them as a CSV file, plot the trajectories, and save the plot as an image file (image_datetime.png).

6. A success message will be displayed in the GUI indicating that the experiment has been completed successfully.

7. The CSV file containing the trajectories will be saved in the directory where the software is located.

8. The plot image file (image_datetime.png) will also be saved in the same directory.

## Theory Review

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate random walks in a 2D space. The random walk is generated by starting at the origin (0, 0) and randomly moving in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The walk continues until the walker reaches a boundary defined by a maximum absolute value of 10 for both x and y coordinates.

The software allows the user to specify the number of trajectories to generate. Each trajectory is represented as a list of (x, y) coordinates, starting from the origin and ending at the boundary. The trajectories are stored in a CSV file, with each row representing a single (x, y) coordinate.

The software also provides a visualization of the trajectories by plotting them on a 2D graph. The x and y coordinates of each trajectory are plotted as a line, resulting in a visual representation of the random walk. The plot is saved as an image file for further analysis or presentation.

For a detailed derivation and explanation of the Monte Carlo method and random walks, please refer to the accompanying .md file.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software provides a user-friendly interface to simulate and visualize random walks in a 2D space. It allows the user to easily generate multiple trajectories, save them as a CSV file, and visualize the results. The software is designed to be easily re-runnable, allowing for further experimentation and analysis.

It is often used to model systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures. The random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path consisting of a succession of random steps. Description A random walk is a stochastic process that describes a path consisting of a series of random steps. It is a mathematical model that can be applied to various domains such as physics, biology, economics, and computer science. In a simple 1D random walk, a walker moves one step to the left or right with equal probability. Monte Carlo Algorithm   Initialization: Set the starting point of the walk and initialize parameters such as the number of steps ( N ) and the probability distribution for each step.   Random Sampling: For each step ( i ) from 1 to ( N ):   Generate a random number to decide the direction of the step.   Update the position based on the direction.     Aggregation: Repeat the random walk multiple times to obtain a distribution of final positions.   Analysis: Analyze the distribution to infer properties such as the mean squared displacement.   Mathematical Derivation Consider a 1D random walk with ( N ) steps. Let ( X_i ) be the position after ( i ) steps, and ( \Delta X ) be the step size. The position after ( N ) steps is: [ X_N = \sum_(i = 1)^(N) \Delta X_i ] If the steps are independent and identically distributed with zero mean and variance ( \sigma^2 ): [ \langle X_N \rangle = 0 ] [ \langle X_N^2 \rangle = N \sigma^2 ] The mean squared displacement ( \langle X_N^2 \rangle ) grows linearly with the number of steps, which is a characteristic of a diffusive process. Applications Physics In physics, random walks are used to model diffusion processes, such as the movement of molecules in a fluid.  Finance In finance, random walks are used to model stock prices and market indices, assuming that the price changes are random and follow a stochastic process. Biology In biology, random walks are used to describe the movement of organisms, such as the foraging patterns of animals or the spread of diseases. Computer Science In computer science, random walks are used in algorithms for optimization and search, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and simulated annealing.

# Monte Carlo Algorithm for Random Walk

## Introduction

The Monte Carlo algorithm for random walk is a computational technique that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results. It is often used to model systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures. The random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path consisting of a succession of random steps.

## Description

A random walk is a stochastic process that describes a path consisting of a series of random steps. It is a mathematical model that can be applied to various domains such as physics, biology, economics, and computer science. In a simple 1D random walk, a walker moves one step to the left or right with equal probability.

### Monte Carlo Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Set the starting point of the walk and initialize parameters such as the number of steps \( N \) and the probability distribution for each step.

2. **Random Sampling**: For each step \( i \) from 1 to \( N \):

    - Generate a random number to decide the direction of the step.

    - Update the position based on the direction.

3. **Aggregation**: Repeat the random walk multiple times to obtain a distribution of final positions.

4. **Analysis**: Analyze the distribution to infer properties such as the mean squared displacement.

### Mathematical Derivation

Consider a 1D random walk with \( N \) steps. Let \( X_i \) be the position after \( i \) steps, and \( \Delta X \) be the step size. The position after \( N \) steps is:

\[ X_N = \sum_(i = 1)^(N) \Delta X_i \]

If the steps are independent and identically distributed with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \):

\[ \langle X_N \rangle = 0 \]

\[ \langle X_N^2 \rangle = N \sigma^2 \]

The mean squared displacement \( \langle X_N^2 \rangle \) grows linearly with the number of steps, which is a characteristic of a diffusive process.

## Applications

### Physics

In physics, random walks are used to model diffusion processes, such as the movement of molecules in a fluid. 

### Finance

In finance, random walks are used to model stock prices and market indices, assuming that the price changes are random and follow a stochastic process.

### Biology

In biology, random walks are used to describe the movement of organisms, such as the foraging patterns of animals or the spread of diseases.

### Computer Science

In computer science, random walks are used in algorithms for optimization and search, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and simulated annealing.

    - Update the position based on the direction.

3. **Aggregation**: Repeat the random walk multiple times to obtain a distribution of final positions.

4. **Analysis**: Analyze the distribution to infer properties such as the mean squared displacement.

### Mathematical Derivation

Consider a 1D random walk with \( N \) steps. Let \( X_i \) be the position after \( i \) steps, and \( \Delta X \) be the step size. The position after \( N \) steps is:

\[ X_N = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \Delta X_i \]

If the steps are independent and identically distributed with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \):

\[ \langle X_N \rangle = 0 \]

\[ \langle X_N^2 \rangle = N \sigma^2 \]

The mean squared displacement \( \langle X_N^2 \rangle \) grows linearly with the number of steps, which is a characteristic of a diffusive process.

## Applications

### Physics

In physics, random walks are used to model diffusion processes, such as the movement of molecules in a fluid. 

### Finance

In finance, random walks are used to model stock prices and market indices, assuming that the price changes are random and follow a stochastic process.

### Biology

In biology, random walks are used to describe the movement of organisms, such as the foraging patterns of animals or the spread of diseases.

### Computer Science

In computer science, random walks are used in algorithms for optimization and search, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and simulated annealing.

 # Monte Carlo Algorithm for Random Walk

## Introduction

The Monte Carlo algorithm for random walk is a computational technique that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results. It is often used to model systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures. The random walk is a mathematical formalization of a path consisting of a succession of random steps.

## Description

A random walk is a stochastic process that describes a path consisting of a series of random steps. It is a mathematical model that can be applied to various domains such as physics, biology, economics, and computer science. In a simple 1D random walk, a walker moves one step to the left or right with equal probability.

### Monte Carlo Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Set the starting point of the walk and initialize parameters such as the number of steps \( N \) and the probability distribution for each step.

2. **Random Sampling**: For each step \( i \) from 1 to \( N \):

    - Generate a random number to decide the direction of the step.

    - Update the position based on the direction.

3. **Aggregation**: Repeat the random walk multiple times to obtain a distribution of final positions.

4. **Analysis**: Analyze the distribution to infer properties such as the mean squared displacement.

### Mathematical Derivation

Consider a 1D random walk with \( N \) steps. Let \( X_i \) be the position after \( i \) steps, and \( \Delta X \) be the step size. The position after \( N \) steps is:

\[ X_N = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \Delta X_i \]

If the steps are independent and identically distributed with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \):

\[ \langle X_N \rangle = 0 \]

\[ \langle X_N^2 \rangle = N \sigma^2 \]

The mean squared displacement \( \langle X_N^2 \rangle \) grows linearly with the number of steps, which is a characteristic of a diffusive process.
