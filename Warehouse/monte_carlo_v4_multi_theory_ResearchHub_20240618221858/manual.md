# Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk User Manual

## Introduction

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software is designed to simulate and visualize random walks in a 2D space. It uses the Monte Carlo method to generate multiple random trajectories and provides the ability to re-run the experiment. The software generates a CSV output file containing the trajectories and saves the resulting plot as an image file.

## Installation

To use the Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

2. Run the following command to start the software:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. The software GUI will open, displaying a text field to enter the number of trajectories and a "Run Experiment" button.

4. Enter the desired number of trajectories in the text field and click the "Run Experiment" button.

5. The software will generate the random trajectories, save them as a CSV file, plot the trajectories, and save the plot as an image file (image_datetime.png).

6. A success message will be displayed in the GUI indicating that the experiment has been completed successfully.

7. The CSV file containing the trajectories will be saved in the directory where the software is located.

8. The plot image file (image_datetime.png) will also be saved in the same directory.

## Theory Review

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate random walks in a 2D space. The random walk is generated by starting at the origin (0, 0) and randomly moving in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The walk continues until the walker reaches a boundary defined by a maximum absolute value of 10 for both x and y coordinates.

The software allows the user to specify the number of trajectories to generate. Each trajectory is represented as a list of (x, y) coordinates, starting from the origin and ending at the boundary. The trajectories are stored in a CSV file, with each row representing a single (x, y) coordinate.

The software also provides a visualization of the trajectories by plotting them on a 2D graph. The x and y coordinates of each trajectory are plotted as a line, resulting in a visual representation of the random walk. The plot is saved as an image file for further analysis or presentation.

For a detailed derivation and explanation of the Monte Carlo method and random walks, please refer to the accompanying .md file.

## Conclusion

The Multi-Trajectories Monte Carlo Random Walk software provides a user-friendly interface to simulate and visualize random walks in a 2D space. It allows the user to easily generate multiple trajectories, save them as a CSV file, and visualize the results. The software is designed to be easily re-runnable, allowing for further experimentation and analysis.
